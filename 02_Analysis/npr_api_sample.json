discussion about the prevalence of sexual assault on U.S. college campuses. That discussion <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/06/481010919/california-rape-case-sentence-sparks-outrage\">has received new momentum</a> recently following outrage over the six month sentence handed to Brock Turner, a former Stanford swimmer, for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.</p>   <p>Vandenburg and another former player, Corey Batey, had been convicted in January 2015, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/01/27/381999482/former-vanderbilt-football-players-found-guilty-in-rape-case\">as The Two-Way reported</a>. But a judge <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/23/416934062/judge-grants-mistrial-in-vanderbilt-rape-case\">declared a mistrial</a> last June, after it emerged that one of the jurors had not disclosed that he had been raped. Batey was convicted again in April, The Associated Press reported. Two other defendants are awaiting trial.</p>   <p>Jurors deliberated for about five hours on Saturday, as WPLN reporter Natasha Senjanovic tells our Newscast unit, and Vandenburg, 23, \"showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered.\" Here's more from Senjanovic:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"Although prosecutors said he may not have physically committed rape, Vandenburg was accused of encouraging three of his former Vanderbilt teammates to do so, in his dorm room. And of taking pictures and video of the assault.</p>   <p>\"The victim didn't even know she had been raped until police showed her that footage. Vandenburg now faces up to 25 years in prison.\"</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>And as <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/06/18/vanderbilt-rape-trial-brandon-vandenburg/86052710/\">The Tennessean reports</a>, \"the victim nodded in the courtroom as the verdicts against the man she once trusted were read one by one.\" It has taken nearly three years to reach this verdict. Sentencing is expected in July, Reuters reports.</p>   <p>\"All of this doesn't happen very often,\" Assistant Attorney General Jan Norman told reporters after the verdict, the <em>Tennessean</em> reports. \"It doesn't happen to a rape victim. The media scrutiny and having it in the headlines every single time there's a hearing and everything is streamed and people are commenting. She is one of the strongest people that I know. She has incredible courage. She is just an amazing, intelligent young woman.\"</p>   <p>Vandenburg's defense has argued that \"he was drunk and should not be held responsible for what players he didn't even know did to the woman,\" the AP reports. On the other hand, the wire service says the prosecution has portrayed him \"as a man who violated the female student's trust by plying her with alcohol and then encouraging teammates to sexually assault her.\"</p>   <p>In her closing arguments, the wire service reports, Norman said: \"He served her up to three strangers - for whatever reason, it doesn't matter, is that he did it.\"</p>   <p>Vandenburg's lawyer Randall Reagan tells the <em>Tennessean</em> that \"there would be an appeal.\"<strong></strong></p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

Her mission, rather than planting apple trees, is to plant the idea of reviving the tea cake, a little cookie that has a lot of historical significance packed into it.</p>   <p>\"There's an old saying,\" Robinson offers as she unpacks a china plate from the bag she's brought to our interview. \"If you don't progress, you'll regress.\" She places a batch of golden cookies on the plate. \"So my thing is, is we can revitalize the tea cake, and allow our young people to know about the heritage that their ancestors provided for them, then it's our responsibility to build upon what we were given.\"</p>   <p>And what better time to do that than on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/06/16/414928122/tell-us-how-do-people-celebrate-juneteenth-in-your-area-wouldntbejuneteenthwitho\" target=\"_blank\">Juneteenth?</a> It's the holiday celebrated in black communities around the country (and in recent years, around the globe) that marks the date \u2014 June 19, 1865 \u2014 when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas finally got word that the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed. The government had sent Army couriers from Washington to all slave-holding states to read the Proclamation aloud to all, but Texas was a long way away. By the time Major General Gordon Granger arrived at the Port of Galveston to spread the news of emancipation, two and a half years had passed. The occasion was commemorated with church services, communal picnics and parades&mdash;a tradition that continues to this day in many places.</p>   <p>The humble tea cake was often part of the celebration. It was, Etha Robinson says, a rustic approximation of the delicate pastries consumed in front parlors when white women entertained visitors. \"Supposedly, tea cakes were made about 200 years ago, in response to the European tea cake, which was actually a cupcake,\" Robinson explains. Kitchens in the big houses had luxuries like sugar and butter. \"At the time of slavery, our folks didn't have refined sugar for the most part. The used molasses, or things of that nature. They didn't often have butter, so they used lard. And eggs, sometimes. And baking powder. Maybe a little nutmeg, if they had any. That was pretty much it.\"</p>   <div id=\"res482512566\" class=\"bucketwrap image small\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/17/tea-cakes_custom-e0792b6fe87d0ff752386c0ce84d8a40416c8148-s200.jpg\" title=\"\"Supposedly, tea cakes were made about 200 years ago.

And if you had it, vanilla. A lot of things we take for granted now were considered luxuries at the time.\"</p>   <p>But the tea cake was more than a cookie. It's many Southerners' equivalent of author <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4648185\" target=\"_blank\">Marcel Proust's madeleine:</a> a small cookie on the surface of things, but laden with emotional resonance. \"We like to say it's more than a cookie,\" she says, \"it's an experience.\" And she wants tea cakes to be as closely associated with black American culture as tortillas are with Latino culture and bagels with Jewish heritage.</p>   <p>Tea cakes aren't much to look at. If they're hand made, they're often not perfectly shaped (well, mine weren't!). But like the Italian hazelnut cookie called Brutti ma Buoni (\"ugly but good\"), the heavenly part is inside. As Robinson lifts the lid of a commemorative tin containing freshly baked tea cakes, the seductive scent of butter, vanilla and almond waft up. Biting into one of Robinson's tea cakes, I discover they're tender, not crisp, and a perfect synthesis of their ingredients. I could eat these forever.</p>   <p>\"I had tea cakes growing up,\" Etha Robinson smiles. \"we were poor, but we were not poor in thinking.\" Growing up in Yazoo City, Mississippi, Robinson says her mother and grandmother made tea cakes regularly. They'd be on hand in the kitchen for little hands to snatch en route to the back yard. \"They had them in old lard cans or glass jars,\" she says.</p>   <p>And because they were hand-friendly (unlike banana pudding or a fruit cobbler), tea cakes often traveled. \"We didn't have regular lunch boxes, so you packed some tea cakes, some fried chicken \u2014 if you were lucky \u2014 and some light bread,\" she say. \"So that would be our snack when we were traveling on the Greyhound bus!\" No reason they can't be brought aboard today's planes. Especially when many people think it feels like riding the bus.</p>   <div id=\"res482668624\" class=\"bucketwrap pullquote\">            <aside role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"pullquote\"><div class=\"bucket\">      <p>We like to say it's more than a cookie; it's an experience.\"</p></div><!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKET\" --><p class=\"byline\">Etha Robinson speaking about tea cakes</p></aside>   </div>   <!-- END ID=\"RES482668624\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP PULLQUOTE\" -->   <p>Robinson says she often brings tea cakes with her when she lectures high school students (she's a retired biology teacher) and she's teaching them about their own heritage. \"If they look back in their family history, somebody made tea cakes. Big Mama, Aunt Corine, somebody. So it's not so much about the cookie itself, it's about making a connection.\" And it's reviving a piece of Afro-culinary history that has long lain dormant. \"During the Great Migration, we lost a lot of the things we did in the South,\" Robinson observes.</p>   <p>This particular tradition is easy to revive. \"I would suggest you Google 'tea cakes,'\" Robinson says, \"there are a variety of tea cake recipes on the internet.\" She pauses. \"Of course, I'm not going to divulge my secret recipe!\" Robinson hopes to market that at some point in African-American museum gift shops, as she once did in Los Angeles. In the meanwhile, she's compiling a Tea Cake anthology; she has been collecting vintage tea cake recipes and the stories behind them in anticipation of publishing a book sometime in the next couple of years.</p>   <p>Till then, there's the interwebs. I found a simple tea cake recipe from Jocelyn Delk Adams. Her <a href=\"http://www.grandbaby-cakes.com/2014/02/southern-tea-cakes/\">Grandbaby Cakes blog</a> begat a cook book last year of the same name. Adams' Southern Tea Cakes Recipe yielded a lusciously tender cookie. (I substituted a teaspoon of almond extract for one of the two vanilla extracts the recipe called for, and added a bit of nutmeg. Worked great.)</p>   <p>So to celebrate Juneteenth, make some tea cakes, and call or visit Big Mama or Aunt Corine and them. And rejoice in your family ties.</p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

No, it's not because I'm a delinquent, disrespectful daughter but something more prosaic: The day to honor dads crossed over to India's shores only a few years ago.</p>   <p>Growing up, I couldn't imagine a special day for mothers or fathers. Whatever for? The last thing a typical Indian kid wants is attention from dad, because that usually means you're in trouble.</p>   <p>In many Indian homes, gender roles are fairly rigid. Fathers are breadwinners, mothers are homemakers. Mom takes care of the day-to-day running of the house, oversees the kids. Dad? Stoic and generally tired, he's the ultimate authority to enforce rules being challenged, scold you for bad grades \u2014 or mete out extra pocket money if he thinks you deserve it.</p>   <p>Growing up in India in the '80s and '90s, my friends and I thought of our fathers as remote but powerful figures. Fathers didn't seem to know what to do with their kids besides boss them around. One friend would watch Hollywood films of dads and sons playing baseball and marvel at the idea.</p>   <p>\"My father was the heavy hand,\" said another friend. \"When he spoke it was like The Master Has Spoken.\" I remember feeling absolutely thunderstruck watching an American dad doing handstands with his kids in a Delhi swimming pool. Who knew dads could do things like that? But, then, he wasn't Indian.</p>   <p>In my house, our conversations, were either about grades (too low) or how much time I spent on the phone (too much). Other than that my father was busy rising through the ranks at the company he joined as a management trainee and retired from as managing director.</p>   <div id=\"res482507976\" class=\"bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col \">            <div class=\"bucket img\">                  <a id=\"featuredStackSquareImage415746178\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/20/415746178/its-hard-for-these-dads-to-talk-about-love-but-they-do\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/sections\\/goatsandsoda\\/2015\\/06\\/20\\/415746178\\/its-hard-for-these-dads-to-talk-about-love-but-they-do\"}' ><img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/06/19/fathers-day-3_sq-9b8784301f1a571c3d2261c340962304f6583aef-s1000.jpg\" title=\"Mayilsami, 67, is a father of one daughter.\" alt=\"Mayilsami, 67, is a father of one daughter.\" /></a>         <div class=\"bucketblock\">                        <h3 class=\"slug\"><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/\">Goats and Soda </a></h3>            <h3><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/20/415746178/its-hard-for-these-dads-to-talk-about-love-but-they-do\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/sections\\/goatsandsoda\\/2015\\/06\\/20\\/415746178\\/its-hard-for-these-dads-to-talk-about-love-but-they-do\"}' > It's Hard For These Dads To Talk About Love ...

On our weekly calls, my father would ask about more than just school. And conforming to the sentiments and rituals of my peers, I started calling him on Father's Day. Over the transatlantic call, he always sounded a bit surprised when I'd say \"Happy Father's Day, thanks for being a great dad.\" I now think that he was surprised by the very notion. Parenting was a duty in his mind; you didn't need to be thanked for doing it.</p>   <p>I moved back to India in 2007, and my relationship with my father grew quite close. I lived with my parents for a year, and at meals, over films, we started to have real conversations, share feelings, thoughts, even talk about the past. But I never expended money or brain-space on what to gift him for Father's Day.</p>   <p>Then in June 2011, out of the blue, my brother asked me, \"What are we giving papa for Father's Day\"?</p>   <p>I blame it on retailers. They began promoting the holiday and offering greeting cards and \"masculine\" gifts.</p>   <p>Clearly, my brother had been brainwashed. As if birthdays weren't hard enough, for the first time ever I found myself scrambling to think of another present for our father.</p>   <p>So far, we've bought him flowers (he was a bit taken aback) and books, and invited him to a brunch he kept trying to wriggle out of. \"Oh, <em>chhado, na,</em><strong><em></em></strong> let it be,\" he kept saying of Father's Day. \"It's just a racket to sell more stuff.\"</p>   <p>But it's hard to resist the pressure. In the last five years, India has appropriated both Mother's and Father's Day with unbridled enthusiasm.</p>   <p>Here's a sampling of subject lines from my inbox just today:</p>   <ul class=\"edTag\">   <li>Dishes dad will love</li>   <li>Make Father's Day special at [restaurant name]</li>   <li>Up to 80 percent off on Father's Day Gift Store #DadKaSwag</li>   <li>Scratching your head for Father's Day gift?</li>   </ul>   <p>Plus coupons to buy dad discounted furniture (What says, \"I love you, dad\" better than a 4-seat dining room set?) and knickknacks (a flask with a mustache decal for the dad who needs booze on the go).</p>   <p>Even small-city malls have huge signs up for Father's Day blowout sales. And if you didn't already know that the holiday is imported, here's a tipoff: All the posters feature white men.</p>   <p>Now it is possible that some Indian dads would be a little embarrassed by a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/Superhero-Cushions-Fathers-Birthday-Anniversary/dp/B00X03CQFG/\" target=\"_blank\">pillowcase</a> that says, \"I love dad, he's my superhero.\" But there's no denying that India's dads have changed. One of my guy friends takes care of his daughter so his wife can go to brunch. Another takes his kids camping. That's not the way my dad did things (although he did have his hip side \u2014 he roller skated and watched Elvis Presley films, played tennis and wore bell bottoms).</p>   <p>So what to give my 71-year-old dad, who thinks gifts for Father's Day are a waste of money?</p>   <p>To find out, I called and asked him.</p>   <p>\"When is Father's Day?\" he countered.</p>   <p>Sunday, I told him, laughing.</p>   <p>\"Nothing,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"Just ... send me a nice message.\"</p>   <p>I said I'd do that anyway.</p>   <p>By this time he was laughing, too. \"Well, then,\" he answered, \"What more do I want?</p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

I depended upon Sofiya, our stern Russian day care provider, for child-rearing advice. She reminded me of my Lithuanian grandmother who took care of me as a child.</p>   <p>When the children caught colds, my husband took their temperature and carefully measured out a draught of flavored Tylenol. Then the children would demand Sofiya's special treatment \u2014 Vicks VapoRub on the soles of their feet.</p>   <div class=\"container medium\" id=\"con482522584\" previewTitle=\"Invisibilia container\">            <h3>Additional Information: </h3>      <h3 class=\"conheader\">The New Norm</h3>      <div id=\"res482522506\" class=\"bucketwrap listtext\">                  <div class=\"bucket\">                        <p>Social norms determine much of our behavior \u2014 how we dress, talk, eat and even what we feel.

Mentholating tiny feet when the cold was affecting very different body parts seemed bizarre, but we were cowed by Sofiya and followed her diktats. And whatever her methods, our kids thrived under her care. (They also behaved impeccably at her house, unlike at home.)</p>   <p>Having someone you trust to ask about health is pretty important. When people have serious health issues, 70 percent of U.S. adults got information or care from a doctor or other health care professional, according to a recent Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/health-fact-sheet/\">survey</a>. But 60 percent said they got information or support from friends and family.</p>   <p>Health and culture are deeply intertwined, and the accepted norms for managing sickness and health vary widely among cultures, even in this globalized era.</p>   <p>Curious if others have had their Vicks VapoRub moments, I polled friends in foreign lands as well as moms from other countries at my kids' Southern California elementary school. They all use Western allopathic medicine, but often combine this with the health mores of their culture of origin.</p>   <div id=\"res482362353\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/16/france_custom-b7639106111f0b5bcf6c715f8757b12cb7c9a302-s1000.jpg\" title=\"Rose Jaffe for NPR\" alt=\"Rose Jaffe for NPR\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">    </div>    <span class=\"credit\">                Rose Jaffe for NPR            </span></div>   </div>   <p>Claire, mother of one of my daughter's friends, said that back in France, people live a more relaxed coexistence with germs than the American scorched-earth policy. \"Wash your hands before you do anything, but wipes are not used.\" Claire said. And French moms appreciate the occasional indulgence; \"A glass of champagne during pregnancy is fine now and then.\"</p>   <p>When you eat your dinner matters in Greece. \"If you eat a heavy meal late at night, you are likely to have a nightmare,\" said Artemis, reporting from Athens. \"Despite warnings, Greeks do eat full meals late, but the old wisdom is that the heaviest meal should be at lunch, unless you go out to dinner. The idea being you eat a yogurt and fruit for dinner. Everyone knows this, but few keep it.\"</p>   <div id=\"res482500106\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/17/greece_custom-80f574d5d6bb454fba2bbf76437a00664d836f2c-s1000.jpeg\" title=\"Rose Jaffe for NPR\" alt=\"Rose Jaffe for NPR\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">    </div>    <span class=\"credit\">                Rose Jaffe for NPR            </span></div>   </div>   <p>And in Southern India, your whole family may set the clock for your wedding night. According to Rekha, another third-grade mom, elders traditionally determine the most auspicious time for consummation after consulting with the family priest. This \"first night\" unites the newly wedded couple in a sacred act of procreation. In the old days, Rehka says, a fire sacrifice was performed followed by chanted mantras, increasing the odds of creating a righteous child with high intellect.</p>   <p>And when it comes to caring for children, many mothers said they rely on traditional methods. For example, the idea managing heat or cold runs across cultures.</p>   <p>When children have fever, Iranian moms wash their feet with lukewarm water, said Emites, who I met at the party for the afterschool Farsi class. \"That's what my great-grandparents used to do, and it passed to us generation by generation.\" she said.</p>   <p>My Chinese correspondents choose between Chinese herbal or Western medicine. Claudia said if a child has fever, the adults have the child drink warm water and wear some thick clothes, with the goal of making the child sweat to release the heat in the body. For a cough, minty oil is applied to the chest to relieve congestion. Applying pressure to specific points on the body can stop the nausea of motion sickness. Another Chinese friend, Samantha, said that when her mom put sugar water on her daughter's bee stings, she stopped complaining almost immediately.</p>   <div id=\"res482497848\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/17/india_custom-4ac4451786e6ca78ba101aaeec4f0d4324011315-s1000.jpeg\" title=\"Rose Jaffe for NPR\" alt=\"Rose Jaffe for NPR\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">    </div>    <span class=\"credit\">                Rose Jaffe for NPR            </span></div>   </div>   <p>For perspective I turned to Leila Monaghan, an anthropologist at Southern Illinois University and Northern Arizona University. \"When you are looking at particular beliefs, they are small parts of a larger picture.\" Monaghan said. \" You can't take them separately. Medicine is always part of a larger belief system, so the French glass of champagne is part of the cultural belief that eating and drinking is part of a healthy lifestyle.\"</p>   <p>Advice from generations of mothers taking care of children is tested by time, Monaghan said. Vicks VapoRub is like peppermint oil, helping feverish little bodies feel cooler. If you can't go to the doctor, you use what you have.</p>   <p>\"You turn to these words of women you know and trust in these matters.\" Monaghan said. \"In some ways it goes back to the whole human need for ritual.\"</p>   <p>Will our kids smear Vicks VapoRub on their children's feet when they grow up, just because we were intimidated by their day care provider?</p>   <p>I wish for a long life, just to find out.</p>   <p><em><a href=\"http://wendywolfson.wordpress.com/\">Wendy Wolfson</a> is a science writer in Orange County, Calif.</em></p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

But as further details emerge about the shooter, investigators say Mateen's profile is more like that of a \"typical mass shooter\" than an individual radicalized by ISIS, as NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports.</p>   <p>In fact, intelligence officials and investigators say they're \"becoming increasingly convinced that the motive for this attack had very little \u2014 or maybe nothing \u2014 to do with ISIS.\"</p>   <p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/18/482594653/orlando-shooter-update-few-warning-signs-point-to-radicalization\">Speaking on Weekend Edition Saturday</a>, Dina says that al-Qaida and ISIS-inspired attacks tend to follow a different pattern. She explains:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"We know that during the attack the gunman posted messages on Facebook saying he was doing this on behalf of ISIS. But officials have yet to find any of the precursors usually associated with radicalization. They've interviewed dozens of people who either knew him or had contact with Mateen.</p>   <p>\"And they say that they've yet to find any indication that he became noticeably more religious, which is one of the indicators of radicalization. He still was going to the same mosque. The way he dressed didn't change. His relationship with his family didn't change in any way. And these are all typically warning signs that parents and friends and educators are told to look for if they're worried that someone they're close to is radicalizing.\"</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>She adds \"this isn't science,\" but so far the signs of radicalization aren't there, which has led investigators to wonder whether the 29-year-old invoked the name of ISIS to garner more publicity for his deadly attack.</p>   <p>The assault resulted in a hostage situation, and Mateen was ultimately killed in a firefight with law enforcement officers.</p>   <p>Investigators have also been struck by \"how closely Mateen's biography adheres to profiles that they associate with typical mass shooters,\" Dina adds:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"He was bullied as a kid in school. He had well-documented behavioral problems. He was aggressive toward other kids. As he got older, things didn't get much better. He took steroids, he jumped from job to job, he had a history of domestic violence. And all these things together fit into a mass shooter's profile.\"</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>Dina says Mateen reportedly beat both his first wife and his second one \u2014 and \"violence and control and power are often precursors to mass attacks.\"</p>   <div id=\"res482621806\" class=\"bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col \">            <div class=\"bucket img\">                  <a id=\"featuredStackSquareImage481787369\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/12/481787369/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-suspected-orlando-shooter\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/sections\\/thetwo-way\\/2016\\/06\\/12\\/481787369\\/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-suspected-orlando-shooter\"}' ><img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/12/ap_320289198943_sq-83b634589f0e7431d2190491ca76049a502e810d-s1000.jpg\" title=\"This undated image shows Omar Mateen, who authorities say killed dozens of people inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., on Sunday.\" alt=\"This undated image shows Omar Mateen, who authorities say killed dozens of people inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., on Sunday.\" /></a>         <div class=\"bucketblock\">                        <h3 class=\"slug\"><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/\">The Two-Way </a></h3>            <h3><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/12/481787369/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-suspected-orlando-shooter\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/sections\\/thetwo-way\\/2016\\/06\\/12\\/481787369\\/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-suspected-orlando-shooter\"}' > What We Know So Far About The Orlando Shooting Suspect </a></h3>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKETBLOCK\" -->      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKET IMG\" -->   </div>   <!-- END ID=\"RES482621806\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL \" -->   <p>You can find our earlier coverage of details that have emerged on Mateen <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/12/481787369/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-suspected-orlando-shooter\">here</a>.</p>   <p>As we reported, Mateen, who was born in New York City, had been interviewed three times by the FBI in two separate investigations \u2014 one regarding inflammatory comments to co-workers and another regarding possible links to Moner Mohammad Abu Salha, a U.S. citizen who blew himself up in Syria.

But part of the reason that fathers who are close to their daughters have problems at their weddings, or are emotional at their weddings, is that it marks this time where \u2014 in metaphorical terms \u2014 you're leaving his home for another.

Who knows if he'll cross that bridge, but if you at least build it, it's there. Daddy's Girl, I actually think keep doing what you're doing, maybe just keep the faith a bit longer."

The mourning process reminds those who love to dance together of something else, too: Liberation is a practice, an insistently loving one, advanced every time people gather to shake off judgment and open their arms to life. The songs enable the practice. They are the conduits through which a superordinary current travels. To reclaim the religious language too often used to justify hate: The songs are the mantras, the beads dancers use when they pray. We present this playlist as a form of witness and of participating in the practice. Be free.</p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

It was a house anthem that I had heard over and over at the End Up in San Francisco when I was an underage go go dancer at Club Uranus, fresh out of the closet and fresh out of Kentucky. The pain and politics of \"Someday\" were oddly resonant in the late eighties, as the devastation of AIDS stalked our partygoing, and its references to oppression, prejudice, racism and fear indexed the very obstacles that made its lyrical promise of living as one family and making the world a Paradise so alluring, and, still, so distant. Absorbing the awful news from Florida, I played \"Someday\" over and over, and then dragged the file into Ableton Live editing software and just looped those gospel chords, listening to that cascading riff, trying to extract some balm. In doing so, I was replaying something that has already been replayed and re-used countless times, notably by Liquid for their rave homage/take off \"Sweet Harmony\" from 1992, which sped up the tempo and soldered breakbeats and rave stabs to the churchy chassis of the Chicago original (a process taken even further for the Concrete Jungle remix of Urban Shakedown's \"Some Justice\", which also raids \"Someday\" for vocal loops). In the wake of Orlando, I could hardly bear to hear the pain in Rogers' voice as he modulates upwards to sing that \"It doesn't have to be like this\".</p><p>Tragedies are tragic because they are avoidable. The force of this song confirms something essential to me: The pleasure and joy of gay dance music and gay dance spaces draw their fire from political imagination and political demand. Here it takes a radically counterfactual form, one cruelly apt to the question of gun control in America. The message is simple: We don't have to keep repeating ourselves. We could have a different world. House can be an escapist narcotic, an inert and formulaic placeholder for pious citations of long exhausted historical moments, but it can also sneak up on clich\u00e9s and make their dry bones live. On the dance floor, you learn these things in your body. Rogers' reference to apartheid in South Africa is a case in point; in the wake of the end of apartheid, the meaning and valence of the song has been transformed within his own lifetime. But it's harder to measure the time it will take to get to where this song is going. \"If we could just open our eyes / we could make our world a Paradise.\" If there's pain, it's the pain of waiting, of deferral, of counting our losses. As queers, how long will we have to wait for someday? <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DDDrewDaniel\" target=\"_blank\">DREW DANIEL</a></strong></p>"

Sleep was not an option while 4 a.m. dancing to DJs like Frankie Knuckles and Louie Vega; after a few sunset hours of puttering around the apartment, I'd hop the subway to honor my nine to five. By the mid- to late-'90s, The Octagon, Escuelita, Caf\u00e9 Con Leche, Phab, Brooklyn Sensation and Langston's were among the trans-borough black and Latino gay clubs (or club nights) that formed my crew's weekly going-out ritual; these spaces were something of a contrast to the decidedly more mainstream (and much paler) megaclubs like Palladium, Twilo and Arena.</p><p>For a transitional '90s moment, the idea of a hip-hop night in a gay club was still decidedly left-curve, so much so that I can recall lining up outside The Warehouse in the Bronx, waiting to get in, wondering if any of us might be mowed down by a drive-by shooter with a phobic axe to grind. I wonder if in our rush to mourn and find logic in the midst of the Orlando catastrophe we've managed to conflate the concept of the commercial, transactional gay nightclub as a <em>safe</em> space with the ideal of the gay nightclub as a <em>convivial</em> space. To attend an LGBT club in a straight-supremacist world used to mean \u2014 and in many places still means \u2014 that you're necessarily exposed in some way; there was always a bit of risk, and safety was rarely guaranteed (particularly if you weren't cisgender). And still, we flocked to spaces like Escuelita and Crash, hell bent on having a kiki-ing with friends, hot in pursuit of a date or a hook-up, dressed to the nines in stylized outfits, determined to see and be seen, awestruck by voguing mavericks battling it out and kinetically dancing the night away until our feet turned sore.</p><p>Even more than Ultra Nat\u00e9's 1997 \"Free,\" \"You Don't Know Me\" is the track that most reminds me of the inspirational anthem pop that 1990s NYC underground house made possible. Duane Harden's impassioned bleat surging atop Armand Van Helden's looping Carrie Lucas disco sample and Jaydee beat was the pre-9/11 zenith of transcendent dance floor pride. The sassy, clapback lyric \u2014 fusing self-esteem sentiments borrowed from ditties as diverse as <em>La Cage Aux Folles</em>' \"I Am What I Am\" and Billy Joel's \"My Life\" \u2014 rides along on a \"don't judge me\" message so in-your-face-potent you wish the Orlando shooter had heard it, internalized it and made much smarter, less lethal choices. Nearly two decades later, I've spent a fair amount of time in queer nightlife spaces in pockets of the world where homosexuality has yet to be decriminalized. There, like everywhere else, the pursuit of conviviality and personal liberation continues; even in the midst of resurgent attempts to repress the marginalized, we find a way to keep dancing. <strong><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/300271619/jason-king\" target=\"_blank\">JASON KING</a></strong></p>"

I had just graduated college and moved to Philly for a music critic internship. Soon after moving there, I became something of a club head. There was virtually no gay club life in my native Little Rock, Ark., and Philly back then still had several hot joints. This one spot, whose name I've long forgotten, played a mix of new and classic dance cuts and drew a beautiful, intergenerational, mostly black and brown crowd. The night the DJ threw on \"Phoenix,\" the older queens whooped and filled the floor right away. Younger ones joined, too. Usually the wallflower, I couldn't resist and ended up dancing with a slim, flirty older guy who sang the lyrics as he danced, hands lifted. After the song segued into another cut, I leaned into the guy's ear and asked him the title of the song.</p><p>\"'Phoenix,' baby,\" he said.\"Aquarian Dream.\"</p><p>It took me almost a decade to find a copy of that song, which transformed that narrow, sweaty space into a righteous sanctuary. Named for the mythical bird that rose strong and glorious from ashes and flames, \"Phoenix\" celebrates the resiliency of the human spirit, something to remember as we grieve the tragedy at Pulse. And as we grieve, perhaps the spirited horns, strings, percussion and churchy vocals will help us imagine a better place for the 49 gone. Their spirits dance on as the song evokes the flight metaphor found in many gospel songs: \"Fly, fly away.\" <strong><a href=\"http://www.rashodollison.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RASHOD OLLISON</a></strong></p>"

I owe so much to its practitioners, its DJs, its participants, for teaching me new ways to be free by example, and for exemplifying transcendence through dance, and for expanding and illuminating ingenious new avenues for femininity to me, a straight, cis Latina from Wyoming. Voguing is a space where words like \"soft\" and \"cunt\" and \"pussy,\" often derogatory in less open spaces, are compliments of the highest order, particularly when accompanied by unwavering displays of athleticism that equate them with physical power, too.</p><p>Adjacent to this is \"Follow Me,\" the 1992 New York City anthem by house trio Aly-us, and one of the most generous songs I've ever heard \u2014 a song that, 24 years later, still has the capacity to uplift me more than 30 years in the church ever did. Specifically anti-racism, its gospel (and gospel influences) resonates for any time and place. Its essential openness and light even now encourages the best possible scenario: a dancefloor of hands lifted in ecstatic prayer, the physical sensation of being truly free. It explicitly imagines the club as a site of inclusivity and the body as its own locus of worship. Follow me... why don't you follow me... to a place where we can be free. This is as plainspoken a mission of house music as there's ever been, an enduring staple of the queer dancefloor that can still elevate the club to a higher place. There's love to share.

We were both 10, and as he describes it, \"Karen was playing soccer with the boys, and I was playing Chinese jump rope with the girls.\" When we were on a class field trip to the murky, man-made Lake Perris, David rode with me and a few other kids in my folks' conversion van, prompting my mom to think wishfully that we were \"an item.\" I suppose we were. How we were became increasingly apparent as we matured awkwardly into our teendom, trying slyly to fit within whatever acceptable parameters of gender-bending the late '80s and early '90s afforded. At one point we both had hairdos resembling Mario Lopez's mullet in <em>Saved by the Bell</em>, though I could never achieve the lustrousness of David's, since he has naturally curly hair, and like most Asian girls of the era, I needed a \"body wave\" just to get mine to take any sort of shape. It was in our senior year as theater kids and members of the Thespian club that David \u2014 who, in a rehearsed cosmopolitan accent, I started calling \"Dahv\" \u2014 brought Deee-Lite's <em>World Clique</em> album to our protoqueer (but really already totally queer), theater dork cast parties.</p><p>While our hetero-confident peers were gregariously practicing their prom night grind to the album's highest charting hit, \"Groove is in the Heart\" (portending its subsequent popularity at many of the straight weddings we'd end up going to years later), Dahv brought us to the house with the nonchalant, cumulative build of \"Good Beat.\" We'd ease into the song with simple, pulsating movements of the head and chest, nodding our assent to the beat that would eventually animate our flesh as if we were elastic, ecstatic windsocks. We sang along with our priestess, Lady Miss Kier (from New York City via Youngstown, Ohio): \"Everything will be alright when you feel it tonight.\" \"Good Beat\" propelled those of us piled into my grandma's Ford Escort station wagon across the full 55 miles of freeway that led to Arena, in the eastern part of West Hollywood. Arena was the 18-and-over queer Latino club where we could do everything for real with other brown queers like us: the intimate strangers who knew when to break out in a tight, rhythmical unison with \"zoo wah zoo wah zoo wah da da...zoo wah...zoo zoo wah....\" We came to the rest of our lives together there to the \"Good Beat,\" to the promise of things getting better, blissfully oblivious to our future worlds in which such scenes of becoming are so easily annihilated. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/inlandemperor\" target=\"_blank\">KAREN TONGSON</a></strong></p>"

I wasn't out even to myself yet, but this was 1979, and we already knew the hippest and most urbane version of ANYTHING was gay. So we went to a downtown gay club called Jim's, and right away spot two of our English teachers. Then this song comes on, about an otherwise strong-willed woman's attraction to what's forbidden. It's sung by one of the ex-members of Labelle, so she really belts, and it's got one of Tom Moulton's classic mixes that breaks down as the background vocalists chant, \"Holding me, touching me, sinner man\" while the track builds more powerful than ever \u2014 as if surrendering to what's supposedly bad for you can make you stronger if you're able to learn from it. That, for me, was the gay experience in a nutshell. Soon after, Jim, Julie and I all came out, and a few years after that, our social studies teacher Tim Mains became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in all of New York State. I'm sure there are people in our hometown who still think we're all sinners, but I wouldn't have made it out alive if I'd believed that. <strong><a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/staff/barry-walters/\" target=\"_blank\">BARRY WALTERS</a></strong></p><p></p>"

With ex-Supreme Diana Ross singing dreamily, languidly, lustily, \"Love Hangover\" begins like a slinky seduction. By the time the song shifts into high gear, the dance floor where I most often danced, Ann Arbor's Rubaiyat Disco, was mobbed, and no one, even the most exuberant dancer, could do more than dance in place. Maybe we were responding exclusively to the infectiousness of this track, which Ross herself once described as not quite a song. But I suspect that for early adopters of disco like myself there was a joy in having this maligned genre affirmed by Ross. No singer that famous had yet ventured into our glitterball world. But there's something else about that song that I think explains why we so crowded the dance floor whenever it played. \"If there's a cure for this, I don't want it\" was Ross's first line. Sure, the song was about love, but for us \u2014 the sexual outsiders, the gender rebels \u2014 \"Love Hangover\" was about our love, queer love, and we weren't looking for a cure either. When I think about those disco days, and how queer people used the club, making ourselves over in the process, I flash back to that song, the feeling of brushing up against strangers, and the sensation of feeling free. <strong><a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003222\" target=\"_blank\">ALICE ECHOLS</a></strong></p>"

The track captures New York party culture at its most mutant and vibrant, for just as nobody had a name for the wild range of sounds that fueled the city's definitively mixed crowds of the early 1970s, so the post-backlash period of the early 1980s witnessed the culture casting genre to one side as musicians captured the kaleidoscopic diversity of the city's dance crowds. \"Go Bang\" expresses not only male pleasure (listen to Julius Eastman's three-and-a-half octave organismic rendition of the title line) but also the the better-than-sex moment when an entire dance floor screams as a sublime record reaches its peak (captured in the line \"I want to see all my friends at once go bang\"). Whenever I hear this record played at a party, I and others enter into a circus of sounds, movements, gestures, expressions, touches and screams as the floor becomes a space of openness and expression that exceeds standard definitions of who we are, allowing us to become collectively who we want to be.

She cared about her community, cared about her church, cared about her God.</p>   <div id=\"res482605302\" class=\"bucketwrap image medium\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/18/gettyimages-478761304-0d2a5f3588b76464e56e37165dab92d077c7cd3a-s300.jpg\" title=\"A program with a cover photograph of Cynthia Hurd, 54, is handed out before her funeral at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where she was killed along with eight others in a mass shooting at the church on June 27, 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina.\" alt=\"A program with a cover photograph of Cynthia Hurd, 54, is handed out before her funeral at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where she was killed along with eight others in a mass shooting at the church on June 27, 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina.\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">        <p><i>            A program with a cover photograph of Cynthia Hurd, 54, is handed out before her funeral at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where she was killed along with eight others in a mass shooting at the church on June 27, 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina.            </i>        </p>    </div>        <span class=\"credit\">                Joe Raedle/Getty Images            </span></div>   </div>   <p>I put it upon myself to be her advocate. I wrote editorials for newspapers and appeared on radio and cable news shows. I went to the National Association of Black Journalists and was a keynote speaker there. I just kind of engulfed myself as a form of therapy, talking about what had gone wrong in our society and what we must do as a community to regain trust. I also wanted to call attention to the elephant in the room: racism and hatred and discrimination. I don't call it gun violence. Certainly the gun was the tool the perpetrator used to commit the crime, but the crime itself was hate and racism and discrimination. To simply call it gun violence disregards what happened that night.</p>   <p>Anytime you talk about racism or race it makes people very uncomfortable, but I believe it was a conversation that needed to be had so I took it upon myself to talk about those issues. And at the same time, it gave me an opportunity to make sure that people knew my sister as more than a victim at the church, that she was a sister, a cousin, an aunt, a librarian, a commissioner, a friend\u2014she was so many other things than a victim.</p>   <p>Our parents passed away in 1984 and 1986, and so in many respects, Cynthia was the matriarch. She was the glue that held everybody together. It was tough for all of us, particularly my sister Jackie. The Friday before Cynthia passed, Jackie was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer. So there was a lot of family stuff going on and we were concerned about Jackie's health and Jackie's life when Cynthia was taken from us.</p>   <div id=\"res482500423\" class=\"bucketwrap pullquote\">            <aside role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"pullquote\"><div class=\"bucket\">      <p>Certainly the gun was the tool the perpetrator used to commit the crime, but the crime itself was hate and racism and discrimination.

I don't think we're fine, but we're better. We are getting used to living without Cynthia. It gives our family pride and honor to know that other people have recognized her. The University of South Carolina, where she got her masters degree, has named a masters scholarship after her. And the housing authority, where she served as a commissioner for 21 years, also established a scholarship after her.</p>   <p>There's still a void there. She was someone I would talk to every day, every other day, by phone or text. I think that's the biggest difference \u2014 no more pep talks from her, no more encouragement from her, no more \"how you doing brother\" from her. It's like losing a cell phone, because that's your information pack. I can't recharge it, I can't get it back.</p>   <p>It would be motherly conversations, it would be sisterly conversations, it would be encouraging conversations as I went about my political career. I served for six years in the Charlotte City Council in North Carolina and 10 years as a member of the state senate, so I'm a political animal. I love politics and government. It's something that Cynthia encouraged me to do and be involved in.</p>   <p>Cynthia was always helping me \u2014 she was a librarian, a great researcher, a great wordsmith \u2014 she edited speeches for me and would say, \"Hey, you might want to say it this way,\" or, \"You know what, I'm gonna rip this up, I'm gonna do it for you.\"</p>   <p>At her funeral service, I gave her eulogy and it was the first time I needed that type of assistance and she wasn't there. Certainly she would have been the person I would have called to say \"I need your help to write this thing,\" or \"proofread it for me.\"</p>   <p>The last time I saw Cynthia, she visited to help celebrate my oldest daughter Nicole's college graduation. And one of the things she kept saying to my youngest daughter, Cortney, is, \"You're up next.\" Cortney graduated from college this year, and Cynthia wasn't there.</p>   <p>I see Cynthia every day because she's on my cell phone screenshot. There was a picture of her that an illustrator did for the alumni magazine at the College of Charleston where she worked part-time, and it's a beautiful picture. I saved it as a part of my screensaver. So every time I pick up the phone to make a call, there she is, with me everywhere I go.</p>   <p>We may be back here again soon. Not in Charleston, not in a church, but somewhere in our country someone is going to experience some type of pain simply because of the proliferation of guns, and the Achilles heel of our country, racism, that we can't seem to get past. So we got to not just forgive and forget, but we have to remember to continue to fight for those things that make our society better today than it was yesterday.</p>   <p><em>This article was originally published by <a href=\"http://thetrace.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Trace</strong></a>, a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America.

<p>She spoke about the \"startlingly banal\" and frightening revelation that a shooter might Facebook during the attack, as well as the overarching need to combat social isolationism that's permeating our society. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>   <div class=\"hr\"><hr></div>   <p><strong>What's the psychological context to what compels mass shooters to turn to social media as the attack unfolds?</strong></p>   <p>Just the background of this: Our serial killers, shooters, pathological \u2014 these people who are harmful in our society live <em>in</em> our society. And so they are going to participate in the mores, in the norms, in the habits that we all share...</p>   <p>I call this \"I share therefore I am,\" because really, so much of our experience of affirming who we are has become sharing what we're doing, sharing what we're eating, sharing what we're seeing. ... Social media isn't something that's happened to us on the outside, it really has become something about our identity.</p>   <p>And so, as much as this young man was pathological and sick \u2014 and I don't want to normalize his behavior in the least \u2014 for him, this atrocity was part of his identity, and the fact that he posted it should be the least of what surprises us.</p>   <p><strong></strong><strong>So is this then sort of an intersection of a pathological mass-murderer with a pre-existing expectation that this is what social media is for, this social validation?</strong></p>   <div id=\"res482546483\" class=\"bucketwrap image medium\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/17/gettyimages-154377056_vert-c911ee741413ee2b3083f960349021c843792181-s300.jpg\" title=\"Sherry Turkle is director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self.\" alt=\"Sherry Turkle is director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self.\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">        <p><i>            Sherry Turkle is <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~sturkle/\" target=\"_blank\">director</a> of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self.            </i>        </p>    </div>        <span class=\"credit\">                Jemal Countess/Getty Images for TIME            </span></div>   </div>   <p>We're in this peculiar spot where most of us post what makes us look good ... and we don't really want to confront that the reality is \u2014 to this man \u2014 doing this, he thought it made him look good. And I think that's the piece that is too horrible for us to confront, because it makes him into someone who is a monster.</p>   <p>I think in the coverage of him, you want to make him into someone who's like us but doesn't have our beliefs, or ... could've been saved if he could be talked out of this, or if he hadn't met these radical Islamists...</p>   <p>We haven't stabilized in a way to think about, who are the people who would do these atrocities? ... And yet they live apparently in our society, holding down jobs, going to the movies, watching TV shows. They live among us, enjoying the pleasures that we do.</p>   <p><strong>It's easier to say, \"this man was insane, pathological and nothing like me,\" but what you're saying \u2014 that his use of Facebook reflects what we do in our daily lives but on a completely different, horrifying scale \u2014 that makes him more like me, and that's what makes me extremely uncomfortable.</strong></p>   <p>This particular action and how we read it \u2014 that he posted things on Facebook \u2014 there are two ways to take. \"Oh, he's such a monster, he advertises his killing spree,\" and that's a way to alienate him from us and say, \"oh he's completely different from us, nothing like us, he's a monster, and I only advertise my beautiful food and put it on Instagram.\"</p>   <p>And then, there's a moment when ... you feel, \"oh my god, he has a Facebook page and he's just posting stuff he's going to do.\" There's something startlingly banal about that... That in some ways, he participated in norm mores, that when you're going to do something, you post it. And that makes him more frightening...</p>   <p><strong>Somebody said something jarring to me about this, which is really wild to think about: Was this guy, in his terrifying way, really after <em>likes</em>?</strong></p>   <p>That's a different question. Is it possible that what these people, who use Facebook for atrocities, are after is approval? ...

[who] look for meaning by acting against America or acting for a cause \u2014 that's a much more classic portrait of people who become extremists and become people who are hurtful to our society. If, in a way that our society hasn't found a place of them, they're alienated from us \u2014 and if only they had been more socially integrated ... they would not have turned against us....</p>   <p>That model suggests that, if he'd been part of a church group, a community group, and wasn't so alienated in the way we live now where so many people are so isolated, alone ... then there are more things we can do, to bring them more into a fold as a society. ... Much more investment in civic structure, in community structure, in churches and synagogues and program and for parents, young people and older people...</p>   <p>That's why I think this Facebook issue opens out so many takes on the story. On the one hand, it makes him more like us, and we have to confront him. And one of the things we have to confront is the degree of our social isolation. Do we feel that it speaks to something that we should act on in our society as a whole, for all of us \u2014 not just the pathological who go off to be radicalized...</p>   <p>Is a way to combat his isolation a way to combat <em>all</em> of our isolation?</p>   <p>Could one response be to say, \"let's put more money in our community infrastructure\"? Instead of saying, \"let's kick everybody out and close the border,\" let's make it so that people who <em>are</em> here feel this is a place of tremendous integration, and community, and hopefulness, where people feel a part and included...</p>   <p><strong>And is your observation that this kind of isolation is a factor of our age of social media?</strong></p>   <p>People always have been isolated; now isolation has a new social pattern to it. It has a new kind of legitimacy ... people have always been isolated, but when they were, there were forces that pushed them out into their community. ... And the question is, is that new pattern giving you back what you need to sustain you?...</p>   <p>I like to say I'm not anti-technology, I'm pro-conversation. ... Really, what matters in the end is, you need to see people. ... We need to think about building a more inclusive society, in which fewer people are isolated.</p>   <p>And that's what I think is scary about these cases: It reminds us how many of us are isolated \u2014 not that many of us are terrorists, but how many of us wish we had more.<strong></strong></p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

It's a fascinating state that both lives in the moment and revels in the past. I'm always ready to live a little, so I couldn't resist reading this <a href=\"http://www.knowlouisiana.org/43934/\">history of the Evangeline Downs race track</a> when it floated through my Twitter feed recently.</p>   <p>Evangeline Downs opened in 1966 in the small town of Carencro, just outside of Lafayette. It's the heart of Acadiana, a place dotted with names like Opelousas and Breaux Bridge. It's also horse racing country, as Alan Broussard and Conni Castille explain in their piece:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"For more than a century, long before the lights blazed above Evangeline Downs, South Louisiana's landscape was scattered with unsanctioned, rural dirt tracks, often adjacent to a barroom with a dance floor.

<p>Vermont has become one of several states working to make sure vasectomies are among the birth control options couples can afford.</p>   <p>Gov. Peter Shumlin last month signed <a href=\"http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/BILLS/H-0620/H-0620%20As%20Passed%20by%20Both%20House%20and%20Senate%20Official.pdf\">into law</a> a bill that adds vasectomies to the list of procedures that <a href=\"http://www.vtvaccine.org/vtvaccine.nsf/documents/18V.S.A.9402.html/$File/18%20V.S.A.%209402.pdf\">most</a> health insurance coverage in Vermont must pay for.</p>   <p>At the Gifford Medical Center in Randolph, Vt., nurse Ann Bridges recently pulled together \"post-operation goody bags\" for what the clinic calls \"Vasectomy Friday\" \u2014 the most popular day of the week to get the permanent birth control operation.</p>   <p>\"Instructions, ice pack, condoms, Bacitracin, sample cups,\" she said, listing items headed to each bag. \"One for each vasectomy.\"</p>   <p>Sterilization is the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr086.pdf\">most common form of birth control</a> relied on by women of reproductive age in the U.S., according to statistics gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 25 percent choose female sterilization, and roughly 5 percent rely on a male partner's vasectomy.</p>   <p>\"For women to be sterilized \u2014 it's quite the procedure,\" Bridges says. \"It's in-patient. You're in the O.R., you have anesthesia onboard, you're six weeks [recovering] \u2014 it's actually a big deal.\"</p>   <p>In contrast, she says, men who get a vasectomy \"walk in and walk out. It's easier.\" Gifford Medical Center charges around $1,400 for the procedure, which is performed in what looks more like a gynecologist's office than an operating theater.</p>   <p>The federal Affordable Care Act only addresses issues of health insurance and birth control as they <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/08/01/138893475/feds-order-insurers-to-cover-birth-control-free-of-charge-to-women\">relate to women</a>.</p>   <p><a href=\"http://legislature.vermont.gov/people/single/2016/15783\">Rep. Christopher Pearson</a>, of Montpelier, who helped oversee the passage of the Vermont legislation, says he's proud to broaden that discussion to include men.</p>   <p>The Vermont legislation was personal for Pearson. His decision to get a vasectomy was a choice he and his wife made together, he says \u2014 \"in many cases, families make this decision together, and that's appropriate.\"</p>   <p>Including the procedure in health care coverage seems obvious to him.</p>   <p>\"It was just sort of a no-brainer,\" he says, \"that when we're talking about different birth control options, we ought to include vasectomies.\"</p>   <p>He says federal legislation has addressed the need to cover birth control - <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/07/08/421140260/women-are-saving-money-thanks-to-expanded-birth-control-coverage\">for women</a>.</p>   <p>\"And what we're saying here in Vermont, and I'm proud of this, is saying, 'No, this is a family decision in many, many cases and we should not pretend that this burden only fall to women at all.' \"</p>   <p>Pearson thinks people living in Vermont, a generally liberal state, often forget that access to birth control is limited in many places.</p>   <p>\"But we are also part of a national dialogue,\" he says, \"and it's important for us to push in the right direction while we watch so many states try to undo these basic rights.\"</p>   <p>Still, where there is birth control, there is controversy. In Vermont's legislative debate, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington argued before the House Health Care Committee for a religious exemption from having to include birth control coverage for its employees.</p>   <p>\"How can you compel a religious organization to do something which it views as cooperation with evil?\" asks <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/deacon-pete-gummere-2258148a\">Pete Gummere</a>, a deacon with the diocese, who has long studied the intersection of morality and modern medicine.</p>   <p>The diocese will likely not be alone in objecting to the law, Gummere says, adding that many locally owned businesses in Vermont are run by families who have religious objections to providing birth control.</p>   <p>On the federal level, Gummere is right; the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that certain rights of corporations with religious affiliations do <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/06/30/327064710/high-court-allows-some-companies-to-opt-out-contraceptives-mandate\">trump federal mandates</a> about contraceptives. But what has not been decided yet is how that will play out for states.</p>   <p>Vermont joins Maryland in adding some birth control benefits for women and men to health coverage. Similiar bills are under consideration in Alaska, Minnesota and a handful of other states.</p>   <p><em>This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local member stations and <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org\">Kaiser Health News</a>.</em></p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 Vermont Public Radio.

A sort of glorified salad buffet, Souplantation is the kind of chain restaurant you go to with your family after church or sports games, particularly after the ones you've lost. The food doesn't inflame the senses or your digestive tract. In his email, he urged us to take advantage of the coupon on his behalf\u2014 with an exclamation mark and a note of regret. I imagined him alone in his high-rise condo in Kaohsiung, looking out onto the leafy muddle, dreaming of pre-washed chlorophyll.</p>   <p>My dad became vegetarian in the '90s. He meditated regularly, and had a particularly intense session in which he saw humans as livestock raised by aliens. This wasn't so weird back then. Our favorite show was <em>X-Files</em>, and also <em>Sightings</em>. The preeminent threat was alien abductions. That summer of 1995, the popular water cooler topic at dad's work was the Fox TV special <em>Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction</em>? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163521/\"></a>Dad had apparently spent a considerable amount of time theorizing about extraterrestrial food chains with his coworkers at the computer wholesale company where he worked in technical support.</p>   <p>One day he came home and announced he could no longer eat meat. Why not? I remember this announcement sent me into a brief panic. My favorite foods were burgers and dumplings, and already, the opportunities to eat them had dwindled since my grandparents from Taiwan had come to live with us several years before.</p>   <p>My grandparents, laconic and mysterious, were also very vegetarian. They belonged to a religion called \"The Persistent Way,\" which combined elements of Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese ancestor worship. My grandma told me we had to be vegetarian because we believed in reincarnation. Each time we ate a pig or chicken, we risked eating one of our ancestors. You just never knew when you'd be biting into a forebear.</p>   <p>I really didn't know how to feel about that. The ancestors whose portraits hung above the altar didn't look very sympathetic. Thin-lipped and grim, they looked like they worked in orphanages. I was scared of them, and felt conflicted about possibly eating them. Should I feel revolted? At school we'd read <em>Charlotte's Web,</em> so I knew that the key to empathy was to imagine these ancestors as capable of witty internal dialogue. Time was a pool party, a great ocean of past and present, and everyone bobbed inside it, the ancestors and me. Rubbing elbows, Marco Polo. But it didn't work. Then again, it was immaterial whether or not I understood the theological underpinnings of the Family Laws. The elders had spoken, and they had to be obeyed. Chens Do No Eat Meat.</p>   <p>Perhaps to counter our rising indignation, my dad assured my sister and me that his vegetarianism was voluntary and not an attempt to placate his parents. His decision was based on a feeling of compassion for animals, not some superstitious belief that eating animals would accumulate bad karma. Since I did not want to think of his vegetarianism as an act of betrayal, I clung instead to his alien explanation. It seemed, to my 10-year-old brain, intuitive enough, following the logic of feeling. I imagined the sum of my existence boiled down to pure caloric value. How would I like to get sucked into a UFO to be used as groceries? I wouldn't like it at all. So it wasn't nice to do it to animals, either, as good as they tasted.</p>   <div id=\"res481895872\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/13/fathersday1_custom-328f1475919c0a51c64df96359b6eba82fc051a6-s1000.jpg\" title=\"Anelise Chen with her father, Henry Chen, and baby sister, Angela Chen.\" alt=\"Anelise Chen with her father, Henry Chen, and baby sister, Angela Chen.\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">        <p><i>            Anelise Chen with her father, Henry Chen, and baby sister, Angela Chen.            </i>        </p>    </div>        <span class=\"credit\">                Courtesy of Anelise Chen            </span></div>   </div>   <p>Though dad was happy to let us eat meat whenever we felt like it, my grandparents prohibited us from even bringing it into the house. So my mom changed up her cooking to accommodate them, which meant that she also couldn't use garlic and onion and other alliaceous plants, as they were considered impure. Not that we had much voting power to begin with, but losing one important member of our meat-eating cohort guaranteed that we had no chance of bargaining. My sister and I endured the soggy plates of saut\u00e9ed sweet potato leaf and ginger, the slimy globs of gluten simmered with seaweed and star anise. We ate without complaining, exercising compassion for my parents. We didn't want to give them grief. Each bite of egg, tomato, hollow leaf, cabbage, every slurp of bland corn soup was an exercise in compassion.</p>   <p>On special occasions, my mom would buy fake meat products from a Buddhist grocer in nearby San Gabriel, Calif., and I would sift through all the vacuum-sealed packages, grumbling, wishing for ribs. It seemed hypocritical to me that these products were manufactured to resemble animals. In spirit, we were still eating \"salmon\" \u2014 pink soy patties covered with mats of seaweed skin. We were still picking at fried nubs of gluten with popsicle sticks for bones. All the violence of the encounter was still implicit in the form. Everyone's compassion seemed phony.</p>   <p>\"Grandma and grandpa are always saying they don't want to kill sentient beings, but I've seen her squish flies like it's nothing,\" I'd say.</p>   <p>\"She say <em>amituofo</em> before she does it,\" dad would say. \"She say sorry to fly in her own way.\"</p>   <p>\"Why's she always talking about compassion when <em>she </em>doesn't have any?\" I'd shoot back. \"I don't think she has any compassion. For example, she has no compassion for my need to eat meat.\"</p>   <p>\"OK. But you have to be compassion.\"</p>   <p>We are probably having this dead-end conversation in the car while driving home from morning swim practice. I am probably in the passenger seat, being treated to a Burger King sausage biscuit breakfast sandwich, ungratefully waving it in his face to get him to cheat. I was always trying to tempt him with meat products by wafting what I thought were irresistible odors into his face. Lately his diet had become dangerously anemic: He seemed to subsist entirely on saltines and handfuls of Ibuprofen.</p>   <p>\"Come on, take one bite! It's so good! Don't you miss it?\" I'd tease.</p>   <p>\"Stop it! Stop! You want your old daddy to get diarrhea?\"</p>   <p>This was the other thing he used to say to get us to stop tempting him.

Auburn Hospital in Boston; Dr. Davidson Hamer, director of the Travel Clinic at Boston University, and Dr. George Rutherford, head of the Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco. They know from their own \u2014 and their patients'&mdash; experiences how critical a kit can be.</p>   <p><strong>Let's start with the tourist who wants to kick back and relax at a posh beach resort \u2014 say, a Caribbean Island or Mexican resort town. </strong></p>   <p>You'll likely eat and sleep in air-conditioned rooms. You might enjoy a screened patio. But eventually, you'll head outside and need a mosquito repellent. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/repellent.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends</a> mosquito sprays containing DEET, picardin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. A well-stocked hotel gift shop \u2014 in tourist magnets like Cancun or Cabo San Lucas \u2014 knows what its guests need. \"If you're going to be visiting places that cater to tourists, they're going to carry products with DEET,\" says Chen.</p>   <p>But even if you think you've covered every bare inch of yourself with repellent, a wily mosquito can find that one square inch you missed. Say you're at a resort in in <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/s.html\">the Solomon Islands in Oceania</a>, a place with a high risk of malaria. The anopheles mosquitoes that carry malaria bite at dusk and dark, and they like to gather under trees to breed and hide out in tree holes. \"If you're standing under a tree at dusk, wearing a bikini, with a drink in your hand and think you're not going to get bitten by a mosquito, you're delusional,\" says Rutherford. Cover your arms and legs with clothing or repellent, he says. Better yet, don't stand under trees at dusk!</p>   <p>In these tropical spots, the sun is another potential hazard. Pack or purchase sunscreen that protects from both UVA and UVB rays and is rated at least SPF15. And the CDC recommends putting sunscreen on first, because it is designed to be absorbed into the skin. After it dries, use the repellent, designed to stay on top of the skin.</p>   <p><strong>If you're staying outside tourist areas but in a place with plenty of retail outlets, can you count on buying supplies like sunscreen and mosquito repellent?</strong></p>   <p>Probably \u2014 but maybe not. A health scare like the Zika virus can send locals and visitors alike clamoring for repellents. \"I talked with a group of students doing research in the Dominican Republic,\" says Chen. \"They brought their own DEET but used it all up. When they went to buy more, the shelves were all empty.\" Some of the students got mosquito bites and came down with <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/01/374198141/painful-virus-sweeps-central-america-gains-a-toehold-in-u-s\">chikungunya</a>, she says. \"If it's possible, bring your own products \u2014 and enough to last,\" she says. Products containing 25 percent DEET or higher will protect for 10 to 12 hours, though they might need to be refreshed if people sweat, or swim.</p>   <p><strong>What if you're really roughing it, in the bush of Africa or the jungles of Latin America or rural villages in Asia?</strong></p>   <p><strong></strong>Repellents alone aren't enough. \"A key thing is whether an area has malaria,\" says Hamer. \"If the risk is moderate to high, an anti-malarial is essential.\" The CDC has a list <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/a.html\"> of areas in the world where malaria is a risk to travelers</a>. You need to start the prescription before you go, take it during your trip and continue for a prescribed time after returning home.</p>   <p>If there's a risk of malaria, and you don't know what your accommodations will be, bring an insecticide-treated bed net. \"Use it in rustic settings or in a private home that may not have good screens,\" says Chen. The CDC says the nets, which come in a variety of sizes, should reach the ground. Depending on the ceiling height from which a net hangs, if it doesn't reach the ground, tuck the bottom ends under the mattress so mosquitoes can't get in. Look for a net that has long-lasting insecticide treatment, developed to repel mosquitoes for up to three years. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/whopes/Long-lasting_insecticidal_nets_November_2015.pdf?ua=1\">World Health Organization has given full or interim approval</a> to 15 such bed nets. They're available in a <a href=\"http://buzzoff.org/mosquito-nets/\">variety of sizes</a>, from small to extra large, and generally cost less than $30.</p>   <p>If you're hiking in Costa Rica, or the forests of Peru, sand flies can get you, and they carry leishmaniasis, a disease that causes sores or damage to internal organs.</p>   <p>DEET is only moderately effective against sand flies, Chen says, so cover exposed skin with long sleeves and long pants. Since sand flies generally bite between twilight and dawn, try to stay inside when the sun is down. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/gen_info/faqs.html#where\">Sand flies are found in Central and South America as well as parts of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.</a></p>   <p>And here's a tip if you find yourself outdoors with a lot of bugs around. Before you go, spray a fairly large scarf with Permethrin, a repellent for use on clothing, shoes, bed nets. \"It's safe to use, even on fine fabrics like silk,\" says Chen. \"If you get to a particularly buggy place, take it out and wrap it around any exposed area of your body.\" The treated scarf should remain protective through four to six washings.</p>   <p><strong>We hate to pry, but are you a going on a sex adventure?</strong></p>   <p>\"That's why [travel medicine experts] have to ask what they'll be doing on their trip,\" says Rutherford. A Bangkok sex tourist would benefit from a Hepatitis B vaccine about a month before traveling, and condoms should be in the medical travel kit. And because Zika has been found to spread sexually from an infected male to his partner, \"sexual exposures in Zika lands is a bad idea,\" he says.</p>   <p><strong>You want to experience the culture and cuisine of the region you're visiting, but it could land you in trouble. Be prepared for gastrointestinal distress or allergic reactions.</strong></p>   <p>Drink bottled water \u2014 that's the resounding chorus of advice. But check out that bottle. \"I stayed at a hotel in India, and the bottled water looked kind of dirty,\" says Hamer. \"I asked where it came from, and they said, 'We fill it from the tap.' I've probably traveled to more than 80 countries, and there's almost no place where I haven't been able to find bottled water. But make sure the seal is intact.\"</p>   <p>Eat peeled fruit, and beware of fresh salads, beautiful garnishes or salsas because they might have been washed in contaminated water. Eat foods that are steaming hot, and \"take a towel and bottled water, and rinse off utensils before using them,\" says Hamer. That way, you'll know that their last rinse and wipe has been with uncontaminated water.</p>   <p>If curiosity or good manners made you eat or drink something your stomach regrets, be prepared. \"Make sure you have Pepto Bismol or Imodium for an upset stomach,\" says Chen. \"We don't recommend using it lightly, but for severe traveler's diarrhea, you might bring a prescription antibiotic.\" With all the fears about overusing antibiotics, Hamer suggests taking them as last resort. Drinking a lot of water, along with Imodium, should be all it takes if the problem is limited to one or two loose stools a day, he says. \"But if you're having many loose bowel movements a day, with a fever or blood in the stool, take an antibiotic,\" he says.</p>   <p>And bring an antihistamine, even if you don't think you have allergies. \"Sometimes people run into something they didn't know they were allergic to,\" says Chen.</p>   <p><strong>Each country presents its own health challenges. How can you be prepared for your destination?</strong></p>   <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/Travel\">country-specific recommendations for immunizations</a> as well as other medical advice for travelers. \"When travelers call [the Travel Medical Center at Mt. Auburn in Boston], we tell them that's a very good resource to start with,\" says Chen. The International Society of Travel Medicine has a <a href=\"http://www.istm.org/\"> </a> to find specialized practitioners who will make individual recommendations before you go, during your trip via phone or email, and after you come home.</p>   <p><strong>Any final words of wisdom for people off on adventures to far-flung corners?</strong></p>   <p>Air pollution is severe in places like India and China. \"If you have lung disease, bring an inhaler, even if you haven't had to use it for years,\" says Chen. \"Pollution can trigger a flare. It's not a bad idea to wear a mask. And if you want to exercise, do it indoors.\"</p>   <p>Will you be traveling on the water? You might pack some seasickness pills, says Hamer. Or climbing mountains? Ask your physician to recommend a drug to combat altitude sickness.</p>   <p>And oh yes, says Rutherford. Inadequate roads, old jalopies and risk-taking cab drivers can be as dangerous as disease-carrying mosquitoes. \"Buckle your seat belt,\" he says. \"And if your cab doesn't have seat belts, get out.\"</p>   <div class=\"hr\"><hr></div></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.

They are 7 and they are not used to losing. As soon as I called the game and they realized what had just happened, two of the boys burst out crying.</p>   <p>The first one cried loudly, and desperately. He was upset because he hadn't run hard enough or passed enough or scored enough goals. It was the cry of a battle commander who had let his troops down, and his father hugged him proudly. The second boy cried because of a minor injury and a general sense of exhaustion. His mom gave him a stern face and whisked him away to the car.</p>   <p>Do we care if our sons cry? When I asked that question on Twitter, a handful of moms immediately wrote me back to say: Of course! I want my son to cry! But I suspect that only applies to the kind of parents who follow me on Twitter, and even less so for the dads. The most fulsome and possibly honest answer I received (from a dad) was: \"I don't mind at all when my 11-year-old cries when he is overcome with emotion. I do mind when he cries over small injuries.\"</p>   <p>My conclusion: I think we care a lot less about boys crying than we used to, but more than we will admit. Or to put it another way: boys can cry, if they do it in just the right way.</p>   <p>The academic research about boys and crying \u2013 or more accurately, vulnerability \u2013 shows that society is right now in a precarious place. One body of research shows that <a href=\"http://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/DiPrete%20&%20Buchmann,%202013%20Briefing%20The-rise-of-women.pdf\">boys will fall further behind in school</a> and in an increasingly complex society if we do not teach them how to be emotionally open and honest, able to recognize and navigate their feelings rather than stuffing them down. But another body of research shows that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html\">teaching boys to accept their own vulnerability is harder than we think.</a> Despite our best intentions, our progressive instincts, and an increasingly gender-fluid society \u2014 the mama's boy stigma dies hard.</p>   <div class=\"container medium\" id=\"con482519617\" previewTitle=\"Invisibilia\">            <h3>Additional Information: </h3>      <h3 class=\"conheader\">The New Norm</h3>      <div id=\"res482517683\" class=\"bucketwrap listtext\">                  <div class=\"bucket\">                        <p>Social norms determine much of your behavior - how we dress, talk, eat and even what we feel.

Nearly 20 years ago <em>The Atlantic</em> ran a cover story about the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/\">boy crisis in schools</a>. Boys were falling behind in math and reading scores, in high school and college graduation rates. For working-class men this translated into a very slim chance of an easy middle-class life, as I wrote about in my 2012 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/End-Men-Rise-Women/dp/B00D9TA4VY\"><em>The End of Men</em></a><em>.</em> Initially researchers thought that what boys needed was more ... boyishness, more rough and tumble play, more adventure stories!</p>   <p>But now it looks like they might need the opposite. In a 2013 report, sociologists <a href=\"http://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/DiPrete%20&%20Buchmann,%202013%20Briefing%20The-rise-of-women.pdf\">Thomas Di Prete and Claudia Buchmann</a> wrote that \"boys' underperformance in school has more to do with society's norms about masculinity than with anatomy, hormones or brain structure.\" Boys who do extracurriculars like music, art and drama tend to get higher grades, they found, but those things are often denigrated as \"un-masculine,\" they write. And they found many examples of boys who strive for good grades being called \"pussies\" or \"fags\" by their peers.</p>   <p>Why at a time when acceptable behavior for women has expanded, do men remain stuck? After all, studies of infants and young children show that <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/35/1/175/\">babies and very young boys are just as emotive</a> as little girls. So why do we socialize it out of them? Sociologist Stephanie Coontz calls this the age of the <a href=\"http://www.stephaniecoontz.com/articles/article93.htm\">masculine mystique</a>. In the 50s and early 60s it was women who were stuck in a box. But now it's men who are trapped in a narrow gender stereotype that \"prevents them from exploring the full range of their individual capabilities,\" she writes.</p>   <p>I own a 1958 book called <em>The Decline of the American Male</em>. It shows a picture of a wickedly indifferent goddess woman pulling the puppet strings of a boy. Chapter One is called \"Why Do Women Dominate Him?\" The fear of female domination runs deep. You can see it in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy\">Gamergate</a>, in <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/donald_trump_has_one_core_philosophy_misogyny.html\">Donald Trump</a>, in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-bro-whisperer/383506/\">bro culture on campus</a>. In fact, it's a strain of misogyny that runs alongside gender equality. Ask the question: \"Can Boys Cry?\" and you are only likely to inflame it, confirm the fear that boys are being forced to conform to a girls' world.</p>   <p>My guess is that there has always been an acceptable category of male vulnerability and that it always looked different from the female kind. You can see it in boys' eternal attraction to superheroes, who are simultaneously invincible and tender. You can see it in boy-men's undying love for Bruce Springsteen. Boys seem magnetized to men who express the full range of emotions. But we have lost that along the way, or at least it's gotten perverted. In her 1999 book <em>Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man</em>, Susan Faludi says that these days boys are modeling themselves on what she calls \"ornamental masculinity\" \u2013 the flattened, crude version of macho that dominates TV and music and porn.</p>   <div id=\"res482521856\" class=\"bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col \">            <div class=\"bucket img\">                  <a id=\"featuredStackSquareImage510307\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/podcasts\\/510307\\/invisibilia\"}' ><img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/05/19/invisibiliapodcast_icon_hotpink-01_sq-2359778531d9733109e3674a5cecf5a711aa511f-s300.jpg\" title=\"Invisibilia logo\" alt=\"Invisibilia logo\" /></a>         <div class=\"bucketblock\">                        <h3><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/podcasts\\/510307\\/invisibilia\"}' > Subscribe to Invisibilia</a></h3>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKETBLOCK\" -->      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKET IMG\" -->   </div>   <!-- END ID=\"RES482521856\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL \" -->   <p>To me the most promising efforts are the ones that address male vulnerability on its own terms, or at least in gender-neutral terms.

He said the company repeatedly asked the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to give it the name of a customer that was shipping illegal drugs so it could stop working with the person, but the agency was either unwilling or unable to do so.</p>   <p>\" 'The dismissal is an act, in the court's view, entirely consistent with the government's overarching obligation to seek justice even at the expense of some embarrassment,' he said, according to a transcript of the hearing.\"</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>This is not the first legal scuffle between the federal government and companies that ship online purchases.

  </div>   <p>A pair of bloodstained shoes has become a symbol of Orlando's defiance in the face of extraordinary trauma.</p>   <p>The shoes belong to Joshua Corsa, a senior surgical resident at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. They were almost brand new when the hospital received scores of victims of the mass shooting attack on a gay nightclub Sunday morning that left 49 people dead.</p>   <p>Corsa tells reporter Abe Aboraya of member station WMFE that he worked in packed operating rooms for some 30 hours. He finally got a chance to try to sleep \u2014 unsuccessfully, he says \u2014 and returned to work on Monday morning.</p>   <p>There to meet him were his bloodstained shoes from the previous day \u2014 and \"that's when a lot of the enormity of it kind of struck me ... that tangible reminder,\" he says.</p>   <div id=\"res482548958\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/17/doctor-shoes_custom-e433e88650305ba95bc6b78af9e0732c7cf4d4cd-s1000.jpg\" title=\"Corsa posted this image of his bloodstained shoes on Facebook Monday morning after hours of caring for Orlando shooting victims.\" alt=\"Corsa posted this image of his bloodstained shoes on Facebook Monday morning after hours of caring for Orlando shooting victims.\" /></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">        <p><i>            Corsa posted this image of his bloodstained shoes on Facebook Monday morning after hours of caring for Orlando shooting victims.            </i>        </p>    </div>        <span class=\"credit\">                Courtesy of Joshua Corsa            </span></div>   </div>   <p>Corsa then sat down and wrote a Facebook post reflecting on the events, which was shared hundreds of thousands of times:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"These are my work shoes from Saturday night. They are brand new, not even a week old. I came to work this morning and saw these in the corner [of] my call room, next to the pile of dirty scrubs.</p>   <p>\"I had forgotten about them until now. On these shoes, soaked between its fibers, is the blood of 54 innocent human beings. I don't know which were straight, which were gay, which were black, or which were Hispanic.</p>   <p>\"What I do know is that they came to us in wave upon wave of suffering, screaming, and death. And somehow, in that chaos, doctors, nurses, technicians, police, paramedics, and others, performed super-human feats of compassion and care.</p>   <p>\"This blood, which poured out of those patients and soaked through my scrubs and shoes, will stain me forever. In these Rorschach patterns of red I will forever see their faces and the faces of those that gave everything they had in those dark hours.</p>   <p>\"There is still an enormous amount of work to be done. Some of that work will never end. And while I work I will continue to wear these shoes. And when the last patient leaves our hospital, I will take them off, and I will keep them in my office.</p>   <p>\"I want to see them in front of me every time I go to work.</p>   <p>\"For on June 12, after the worst of humanity reared its evil head, I saw the best of humanity ... come fighting right back. I never want to forget that night.\"</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>The powerful post has since been made private.

But most importantly, it is against the law,\" reads a statement from the American Beverage Association.</p>   <p>The group says it will take legal action to stop the tax. \"Similar tax proposals have been rejected 43 times across the country in the past eight years,\" the ABA says. And the industry points to polling data that suggest the majority of Philadelphia residents don't support it.</p>   <p>But supporters of the tax on sweetened drinks say the victory in Philadelphia could set the stage for similar actions in cities across the country.</p>   <p>\"Philadelphia will almost certainly not be the last city to adopt a sugary drinks tax. In fact, the question now is not whether any city will follow suit, but rather how many \u2014 and how quickly?\" wrote Michael Bloomberg in a statement released Friday.</p>   <p>As we've reported, Bloomberg \u2014 who took on sodas as mayor of New York City \u2014 contributed significantly to a media campaign in Philadelphia aimed at passing the soda-tax measure.</p>   <p>\"Obesity and poverty are both intractable national problems.

This night, however, was the last night for 49 of them. They couldn't say, \"See you in the morning.\" Their good night was silenced by the sound of a rifle that spewed hate and spilled their blood.</p>   <p>The pulse of Pulse nightclub stopped that night. But for me, as a black gay man who fled Nigeria for the United Kingdom because I was attacked for my sexuality, the news made my pulse pound harder. It brought me back to a time when I saw Orlando in my everyday life.</p>   <p>One horrific incident occurred in 2006 in the area where I grew up in Nigeria. My friends and I were attending one of the many underground gay parties in Lagos, the former capital and the economic hub of Nigeria, the most populous black nation in the world.</p>   <p>The party, like the one in Orlando, was in full swing, but we were aware that in this part of the world our safety was never guaranteed. Halfway through, a group of thugs hijacked the party. We heard the first gunshot, and then beer bottles started flying. Before we could make sense of what was happening, blood was flowing, people were screaming and possessions were being stolen with a violence I had never seen before. I suffered a broken jaw. A friend had a concussion. Two friends walked home barefoot because their shoes were taken off them.</p>   <p>Our underground parties have always been disrupted by hoodlums and homophobes. They see us as easy prey and know that we will never get protection from the police. And in many cases, the attackers are never arrested. Sometimes they are even praised for doing a good job cleansing the society of evil.</p>   <div class=\"container medium nobar\" id=\"con482529587\" previewTitle=\"Related NPR Stories\">            <h3>Additional Information: </h3>      <h3 class=\"conheader\">Related NPR Stories</h3>      <div id=\"res482529586\" class=\"bucketwrap internallink simple\">                  <div class=\"simple\">                        <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/06/16/482301554/how-lgbtq-people-of-color-are-dealing-with-orlando-code-switch-podcast-episode-4\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/sections\\/codeswitch\\/2016\\/06\\/16\\/482301554\\/how-lgbtq-people-of-color-are-dealing-with-orlando-code-switch-podcast-episode-4\"}' > How LGBTQ People Of Color Are Dealing With Orlando: Code Switch Podcast, Episode 4</a>                         <span class=\"date\">June 16, 2016</span>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"SIMPLE\" -->      </div>      <!-- END ID=\"RES482529586\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK SIMPLE\" -->   </div>   <!-- END CLASS=\"CONTAINER MEDIUM NOBAR\" ID=\"CON482529587\" PREVIEWTITLE=\"RELATED NPR STORIES\" -->   <p>Despite the dangers, attending these parties were a way of reaffirming a sense of community and solidarity.</p>   <p>In African countries like Gambia, Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe, LGBT people live every day of their lives with the hate and fear that permeated Orlando's nightclub.</p>   <p>That was why it was painful and insulting when Goodluck Jonathan, the former president of Nigeria, <a href=\"http://www.gistplanet365.com/2016/06/13/jonathan-sympathized-with-united-states-and-florida-over-mass-shooting-at-orlando-nightclub/\">tweeted his condolences to America</a> without acknowledging the sexuality of the victims. But it was even more insulting that a man who signed an <a href=\"http://www.humandignitytrust.org/uploaded/Library/Other_Material/Briefing_on_Same_Sex_Marriage_Prohibition_Act_2013_final.pdf\">Anti-Same Sex Marriage law</a>, which stipulates 14 years imprisonment for entering into a same sex marriage, would offer his prayers to the friends and families of the victims. He himself laid the groundwork for the homophobic law that has ruined many lives and put LGBT people in danger.</p>   <p>What if we moved the Orlando attack out of Florida and situated it in Nigeria, at the same day, same time, with the same number of casualties? The Anti-Same Sex Marriage law says that anyone who provides services for homosexuals could be put in jail for five years. The problem is that the law doesn't specify what \"services\" means, so it's open to interpretation. If we had scores of LGBT people dying \u2014 our brothers and sisters \u2014 and they needed blood and medical attention, doctors, health care workers and police might say they can't help because of the law.</p>   <p>It was not just that personal connection that made me feel like I am Orlando, though I live thousands of miles away.</p>   <p>It was the fact that in my view, some politicians and members of the international media underplayed the homophobic nature of the attack. In doing this, they failed to recognize the pain we feel as a community. They cheapened our suffering.</p>   <p>Then there was the possible motivation of a kiss. The father of the Orlando attacker told NBC News that a few months ago, his son grew angry when he saw two men kissing.</p>   <p>Last year, I posted on social media a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/11/after-i-kissed-my-boyfriend-10-people-said-they-wanted-to-kill-me/\">picture of my fianc\u00e9 and me kissing</a> at my 40th birthday.

For Brazilians whose jobs depend on the bay, it's a long-term problem that's only getting worse.</p>   <p>Alexandre Anderson, who heads the region's largest fishermen's association, took me out onto the water to show me the extent of Rio de Janeiro's water crisis.</p>   <p>\"There is the bay for the rich, for visitors to see, but there is also the bay of the fishermen, who are suffering. That is the bay of excrement, garbage and oil. It is the Guanabara Bay of violence,\" he says.</p>   <p>That violence has cost some fishermen their lives. Back in 2009, attackers tied a member of the fishermen's association to his boat and riddled him with bullets. Other fishermen have disappeared.</p>   <p>Anderson himself is a hunted man. He is under federal protection and lives in a secret location.</p>   <p>Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be an environmental defender \u2014 more have been killed here than almost anywhere on earth.</p>   <p>\"They shot at me in front of the fishermen's association, shrapnel hit my waist, but I knew that I should continue to fight,\" Anderson recounts.</p>   <p>What he is fighting against is what is costing the fishermen their livelihood: pollution.</p>   <p>Fish in the bay are dying off or are too full of chemicals and toxins for people to eat. There are many causes, including raw sewage and garbage dumped into the bay by communities that don't have access to sanitation infrastructure.</p>   <p>But there's another culprit, according to Anderson \u2014 the oil and gas industry. While the world knows Rio for its famous beaches, it's also the center of the country's energy sector.</p>   <p>Oil and gas accounted for 13 percent of Brazil's GDP in 2014 and the bay has become the hub for oil development projects, even though the actual wells are farther offshore in deeper waters.</p>   <p>Petrobras, the state oil company at the center of a massive corruption scandal in Brazil, was responsible for oil spills on this bay in 2000 and 2015.</p>   <div id=\"res482515685\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/06/17/gettyimages-1478249151-b3f74bd5ab7175cdeae21c88aa7088d0ab248a6b-s1000.jpg\" title=\"Alexandre Anderson, president of a fishermen's association, stands near Guanabara Bay, guarded by two policemen, in 2012.

He blames murky forces allied with the oil industry for the violence.</p>   <p>We pull up to a large shipyard on the banks of the bay. Anderson points to eco-barriers that are meant to stop chemicals getting farther into the water. But many of them are broken and the water is a murky black. He dips his hands into the water and they come up stained.</p>   <p>We then cross the water to the biggest refinery in the region, and there are broken barriers there, too. Oil pools around the base of mangroves.</p>   <p>Anderson spends his days documenting these infractions. He says he is targeted because he is trying to protect this fragile ecosystem, while the authorities do little or nothing.</p>   <p>\"We fishermen understand that the Guanabara Bay has life yet,\" he says. \"The Guanabara Bay is a nursery for many species. If only they would stop polluting and the government would start acting.\"</p>   <p>As part of Rio's bid for the 2016 Summer Games, Brazil promised to clean up the bay. The fishermen had hoped the authorities would finally crack down on what was happening, but they say all they have now are broken promises.</p>   <p>As the bay has become busier, the fishermen have seen the area in which they operate diminish. Petrobras has created exclusion zones around its infrastructure and federal prosecutors have had to repeatedly get involved.</p>   <p>One of them is Lauro Coelho Jr., who told us there are ongoing investigations into multiple deaths and disappearances of fishermen since 2000.</p>   <p>\"The oil industry is involved in an environmental and economic conflict in which there is a clash between development and the environment,\" he told us. \"And in the midst of this conflict, deaths occurred.\"</p>   <div class=\"container small\" id=\"con482519555\" previewTitle=\"a\">            <h3>Additional Information: </h3>      <h3 class=\"conheader\">Related Stories</h3>      <div id=\"res482519158\" class=\"bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col \">                  <div class=\"bucket img\">                        <a id=\"featuredStackSquareImage463030768\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/01/14/463030768/amid-recession-brazil-struggles-with-the-huge-costs-of-the-olympics\"  data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\/\\/www.npr.org\\/sections\\/parallels\\/2016\\/01\\/14\\/463030768\\/amid-recession-brazil-struggles-with-the-huge-costs-of-the-olympics\"}' ><img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/01/14/rio-jan-14-16_sq-6871e3dcf9cfbd6cfc94b0f02df05b437b7c11b6-s1000.jpg\" title=\"A boy fishes in polluted Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro in August 2015.

The interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p>   <h3 class=\"edTag\"></h3>   <div class=\"hr\"><hr></div>   <p><strong>A few years after your release from the LRA you started using a recorder to keep an oral diary of your day-to-day experiences as well as your memories of your time in captivity. You started every entry with the words, \"I am Evelyn Amony.\" Why?</strong></p>   <p>It was part of adjusting and getting back to my original self. When I was abducted, I had to use a fake name because if you used your real name the LRA might trace your relatives back home and wreak havoc there. So from the very first day I gave them the fake name \"Betty Ato.\" When I returned home my relatives were still calling me Evelyn Amony. But I was so used to being Betty Ato. It took me some years to start feeling that sense of, \"OK, I am Eveyln Amony. I'm not Betty Ato.\"</p>   <p><strong>Who is Evelyn Amony and how is she different from Betty Ato?</strong></p>   <p>When I was in the jungle and I was called Betty Ato, I only used to have bad experiences. I used to see only bad things. But the Evelyn Amony that I am today, well ... just look! Right now I'm in New York City!</p>   <p><strong>Evelyn Amony is a happy person? </strong></p>   <p>Oh yes.</p>   <p><strong>But it sounds like it took a while to get to that point. And the process of recovering was made more difficult by some of the reactions from people after you were freed. What was the most hurtful or ignorant thing they would say to you?</strong></p>   <p>They would ask me questions like, \"Why didn't you return sooner? You must have taken so long because you loved Kony.\" Such questions made me feel so hurt. They just wouldn't understand what life was like when I was there [with the LRA].</p>   <div class=\"container book nobar\" id=\"con482522179\" previewTitle=\"Book Edition Information\">            <h3>Additional Information: </h3>      <div id=\"res482522209\" class=\"bucketwrap image book\">                  <div class=\"imagewrap\" data-crop-type=\"\">    <a href=\"/books/titles/482522108/i-am-evelyn-amony-reclaiming-my-life-from-the-lords-resistance-army\">        <img src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/bakertaylor/covers/i/i-am-evelyn-amony/9780299304942_custom-efa719bd2994d71e4d23b48b64f62a8f3288ff97-s300.jpg\" title=\"I Am Evelyn Amony\" alt=\"I Am Evelyn Amony\" />    </a></div><div class=\"credit-caption\">    <div class=\"caption\">    </div></div>      </div>      <div id=\"res482522146\" class=\"bucketwrap bookedition\">                  <h6><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/482522108/i-am-evelyn-amony-reclaiming-my-life-from-the-lords-resistance-army\">I Am Evelyn Amony</a></h6>         <p>Reclaiming My Life from the Lord's Resistance Army</p>         <p class=\"author\">by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/authors/482522113/evelyn-amony\"><span>Evelyn Amony</span></a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/authors/482522121/erin-baines\"><span>Erin Baines</span></a></p>         <div class=\"bookinfo\">                        <p>Paperback, 181 pages <span class=\"pipe\">|</span></p>            <a href=\"#\" class=\"purchase\" data-metrics='{\"category\":\"Ecommerce\",\"action\":\"Click purchase book\"}' >purchase</a>            <div class=\"ecommercepop\">                              <div class=\"ecomm_body\">                                    <button class='btn-close'>close overlay</button>                  <h3>Buy Featured Book</h3>                  <dl class=\"meta\"><dt>Title</dt><dd>I Am Evelyn Amony</dd><dt>Subtitle</dt><dd>Reclaiming My Life from the Lord's Resistance Army</dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Evelyn Amony and Erin Baines</dd></dl>                  <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"ecommerceId\" value=\"3\" />                  <p class=\"support\">Your purchase helps support NPR programming. <a href=\"http://help.npr.org/customer/portal/articles/2168887-how-can-my-online-purchases-support-npr-programming\">How?</a></p>                  <ul class=\"purchase-links\">                                          <li><a  data-metrics='{\"action\":\"Click Amazon\",\"category\":\"Ecommerce\",\"label\":\"9780299304942\"}'  class=\"buylink1\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Am-Evelyn-Amony-Reclaiming-Resistance/dp/0299304949%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJXORMQMQBISBPIPQ%26tag%3Dnpr-5-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0299304949\">Amazon</a></li>                     <li><a  data-metrics='{\"action\":\"Click Independent Booksellers\",\"category\":\"Ecommerce\",\"label\":\"9780299304942\"}'  class=\"buyLink3\" href=\"http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780299304942?aff=NPR\">Independent Booksellers</a></li>                  </ul>               </div>               <!-- END CLASS=\"ECOMM_BODY\" -->            </div>            <!-- END CLASS=\"ECOMMERCEPOP\" -->         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"BOOKINFO\" -->      </div>      <!-- END ID=\"RES482522146\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP BOOKEDITION\" -->   </div>   <!-- END CLASS=\"CONTAINER BOOK NOBAR\" ID=\"CON482522179\" PREVIEWTITLE=\"BOOK EDITION INFORMATION\" -->   <p><strong>They didn't get how difficult it was to escape?</strong></p>   <p>Yes. You know, some people were abducted when they were older, and they had the ability to trace directions and return home. But I was abducted when I was very young, and I couldn't tell that if you take this route you can reach home. So it was hard for me to escape. Also, you know the LRA has so many tactics. They used to tell us if you escape and go back home you will be killed. When a girl tried to escape and she was gang-raped and maybe killed by Ugandan government soldiers they would call all the younger girls to come and see it \u2014 to say, \"See if you try to escape this is what will happen to you.\" And there were people who tried to escape and were caught [by the LRA] and killed. Very ugly scenes, that if you've seen that you decide to stay with the LRA and not try to leave.</p>   <p><strong>Was it hard to explain all this to relatives and friends?</strong></p>   <p>Yes, when I first returned it was just so hard for me to respond to questions, I would just keep quiet. There were secrets I didn't want to tell anyone. And when I did start to tell my relatives they would start crying so much I would have to stop. But the process of writing the book gave me the courage to express myself and to tell the difficult stories I wouldn't have told. I've given copies to my father and my brothers and they are reading it, so I think they will be able to understand.</p>   <p><strong>People also had a hard time understanding your relationship with Joseph Kony \u2014 the LRA's leader. On the one hand, he was among the men most responsible for your abduction and suffering. On the other hand, he was one of the people you came to depend on to survive.</strong></p>   <p>In the beginning, just after I was abducted, I was taken to a certain place to be killed. And it was Kony that came and saved me and said I shouldn't be killed. Then another time, when I was drowning in a river, it was Kony who jumped into the water and pulled me out. So it is very hard to know if people can understand what I went through with regard to that relationship. Some of the ways in which I lived with him can be seen by people as me liking him. But I want people to understand that the times I had with him that were good were a way for me to remain alive and give me the opportunity someday to return home.</p>   <p><strong>What has it been like for your children by Kony \u2014 your daughters Bakita, who is 19, and Grace, who is 11. (Her middle daughter, Winnie, disappeared during bombardment by the Ugandan military while Amony was still with the LRA and has never been found). </strong></p>   <p>My children are not welcome in my village. Community members say to me: \"Our children were abducted by the LRA. They were killed by the LRA. And now you bring LRA children here \u2014 Kony's kids here and we have to take care of his kids when he killed our own.\"</p>   <p><strong>But clearly this is not your view.</strong></p>   <p>These are your children. They came out of your body and you don't want to just let go of them, however much your family does not like them. So you find yourself torn between wanting to care for your children and the reaction of your family members.</p>   <p><strong>How have you resolved this</strong>?</p>   <p>This is the reason I don't take my children back to my home village. Because they don't love my children. But I continue to go back there because that is our home. They can't tell me I can't go. But I don't want my children to deal with that.</p>   <p><strong>Do you worry that your children will grow up feeling bad that they were the product of a forced marriage? Have you discussed it with them?</strong></p>   <p>I am not yet ready to explain to my children that they are a product of a forced marriage. But my eldest she knows. She remembers some of the things. And she's read my book. And certain things she's told me make me feel she understands. After reading the book she told me she wants to study hard to become a lawyer and to advocate for the rights of other women who go through this experience.</p>   <p><strong>You are in New York to meet with other survivors of these kinds of abductions along with people who work to help them recover. What are the lessons from your own journey that could benefit others?</strong></p>   <p>The first stage is to get psycho-social counseling. Secondly, there is a need to stay very close to the people who are returning from the jungle \u2014 you shouldn't leave them to live on their own. Another important part of the process is for those who have gone through this to stay together in groups. When you can provide peer support to each other and just tell each other the stories about what you went through together, that's what makes you feel good.</p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2016 NPR.
